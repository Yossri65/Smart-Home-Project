The Smart Home Project is a comprehensive system designed to control various aspects of a home, including lighting, television, and air conditioning. It incorporates error handling to handle incorrect menu choices and provides a user-friendly interface through an LCD screen.

During the first-time setup, the system prompts the user to set passwords for both Admin mode and Guest mode. This ensures secure access to the system. The passwords are entered twice to minimize errors.

Upon subsequent access to the system, the password setup process is skipped, streamlining the login experience.

After entering the system, the user is prompted to choose between Admin mode and Guest mode. This selection determines the level of control and access available within the system.

In Guest mode, the user is required to enter a 4-digit password. They have three attempts to enter the correct password. If an incorrect password is entered, the system enters a block mode for 10 seconds as a security measure. After the block mode, the system automatically restarts itself. However, if the correct password is entered, the user gains access to a menu with options to control the lights in four different rooms (Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, and Room 4). It's important to note that in Guest mode, there is a limited time of 25 seconds to perform actions within the system before it restarts automatically.

Admin mode provides higher privileges within the system. While the specific features and functionalities available in Admin mode are not detailed, it can be assumed that it includes control over the lights in different rooms, as well as additional control over the television unit and air conditioner.

The air conditioning feature allows the user to control the air conditioner's power (ON/OFF) and set the desired temperature. The current status of the air conditioner is displayed on the LCD screen, and the user can navigate through the options using a keypad. The program ensures that the temperature entered remains within a valid range, such as up to 35 degrees Celsius.

The code structure utilizes loops and conditional statements to facilitate menu navigation and user interactions. It waits for keypad inputs, performs the corresponding actions based on the selected options, and provides appropriate feedback on the LCD screen.

Overall, the Smart Home Project offers a user-friendly interface, password protection, and different access levels to ensure security and control over various aspects of a home.
